Hi, my name is Taseen Tanvir! ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)
======================================================================================================================================

I left high school at 15 to chase my tech dreams – started as an engineer at a major AI art app, experienced the ups and downs of founding a startup, and now I'm coding at a YC company.

My fascination with technology began early. I was the guy in high school who could fix your phone or laptop. But I wanted more – I wanted to solve problems for everyone, not just one person at a time. This desire led me to the world of programming & design.

I began with sketching website designs by hand and then got really good at using Figma to create complete website layouts. I taught myself how to code these designs, making sure every detail was perfect on the actual website and before I knew it, I was diving deep into the React and Next.js ecosystems, mastering TypeScript, TailwindCSS. I even expanded into backend and databases, taking a shot at my own startup.

Everything took an exciting turn when I became a design engineer at StarryAI, a state-of-the-art AI art generator. The thrill of building something from the ground up was exhilarating. But I didn't stop there. I went on to co-found a startup, immersing myself in the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship. And now, I'm bringing my passion for coding and design to Vocode, a promising startup in YC's W23 batch.

Up to this point, my focus was on soaking up as much knowledge as possible, setting myself apart in the process. But now, I feel a strong call to give back to the community that has been my backbone. Feel free to find me on my socials and let's connect.
